# VerifAI – Agentic AI for Real-Time Fraud Prevention

VerifAI is an agentic, AI-first fraud prevention system designed for real-time digital payment security.  
The system introduces autonomous decision-making to reduce fraud, minimize false positives, and preserve user trust in high-scale payment ecosystems like UPI.

## 🧠 Solution Summary

VerifAI replaces traditional binary fraud detection with an **agentic decision framework** that:
- Evaluates transaction context in real time
- Introduces a third decision state (**HOLD**) for user verification
- Reduces false positives without increasing fraud risk
- Operates within sub-100ms latency requirements

Detailed specifications and design decisions are documented in the linked files above.
